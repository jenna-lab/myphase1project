# Introduction

Welcome to JavaScript Project Mode!

Youâ€™ve worked so hard to get here and have learned a ton. Now it's time to bring it all together!

For this project, you're going build a Single Page Application (SPA). Building this application will be challenging because it will integrate everything you've learned up to this point. Your frontend will be built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript and will communicate with a public API.
